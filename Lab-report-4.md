###  Part 2

Which of these two styles would you prefer using if you had to work on a program that you were running remotely, and why?

I would perfer to do the second method, because its more safer in my opinion to work on a remote server as you don't risk loosing the files or changes to said file id the computer is dameged.

What about the project or task might factor into your decision one way or another? (If nothing would affect your decision, say so and why!)

The most important factor would be the concern of loosing the data for example if a app needs a very urgent change i would much rather be able to log in to any laptop and complete the changes than finding the one specif laptop that began the changes.
