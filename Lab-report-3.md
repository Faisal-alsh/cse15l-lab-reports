## ```Consider the command find```

When running the command 'man find' I can find (Pun not intended) the commands it can uses and there descriptions.

 ## ```- name```
 To illustrate the use of the find command I used it with -name and '*'. the '*' is as if saying give me what ever thing that fit the format of *.java so like anything.java, and the for the -name as described in the manual :
 
 
       -name  This option is supported, but POSIX conformance depends  on
              the  POSIX  conformance  of the system's fnmatch(3) library
              function.   As  of  findutils-4.2.2,  shell  metacharacters
              (`*',  `?'  or  `[]' for example) will match a leading `.',
              because IEEE PASC interpretation 126 requires  this.   This
              is a change from previous versions of findutils.

You can  use "*" The star charectar to genrilize the search. For example In the screenshot below I have Search for anything that Starts with "chapters" it does not matter what comes after, this is the power of the Star charecter with the - name command.

Now I have Searched for anything that Starts with a "s"

 ## ```- type```
 
  To further illustrate the use of the find command I used it with - type , This command is a usful quiry to add to the find fuction to specify the type of the intended result. It can be used to specify multiple types like : 
    File is of type c:

              b      block (buffered) special

              c      character (unbuffered) special

              d      directory

              p      named pipe (FIFO)

              f      regular file

              l      symbolic  link;  this is never true if the -L option
                     or the -follow option is in effect, unless the  sym‚Äê
                     bolic  link  is  broken.   If you want to search for
                     symbolic links when -L is in effect, use -xtype.

              s      socket

              D      door (Solaris)
