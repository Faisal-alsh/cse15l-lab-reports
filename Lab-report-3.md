## ```Consider the command find```

When running the command 'man find' I can find (Pun not intended) the commands it can uses and there descriptions.

 To illustrate the use of the find command I used it with -name and '*'. the '*' is as if saying give me what ever thing that fit the format of *.java so like anything.java, and the for the -name as described in the manual : " True if the last component of the pathname being examined matches pattern.  Special shell pattern matching characters (“[”, “]”, “*”, and “?”) may be
             used as part of pattern.  These characters may be matched explicitly by escaping them with a backslash (“\”)."
