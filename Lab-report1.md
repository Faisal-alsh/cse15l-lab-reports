## Installing IDE:

To install VScode, start by visiting [https://code.visualstudio.com/download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), then download the appropriate version. When you open the app, you should see something similar to this.

## Remotely Connecting:

Open the terminal in VScode.

Then, type `$ ssh cs15lfa22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu.` and replace **cs15lwi22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu.** with your own address

You might see this massage if this was your frist time to connect: 

**â¤‡ ssh cs15lfa22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu**
**The authenticity of host 'ieng6.ucsd.edu (128.54.70.227)' can't be established.**
**RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:ksruYwhnYH+sySHnHAtLUHngrPEyZTDl/1x99wUQcec.**
**Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?**

**Enter yes**

Then Enter Your password

Then Somthing like this should show up:

 Cd.. lets you gp back a derictory
 
 ls   Gives you the conteants if the given directory
 
 Cat Gives you the code of the code file 
 
 Javac Compiles the java file
 
 


## NOW We move Files with `scp`:

Use `scp` command to copy files from the client(your desktop, to the server).

## Let's set up an SSH Key:

This step will help you avoid typing down the passowrd when running ```ssh `or` scp```.
Start by running `ssh-keygen` on your device, which will creates two files *public key*(`id_rsa.pub`) and *privte key*(`id_rsa`) stored in `.ssh`.

## Optimizing:

To make running commands on the server a bit easier and faster you can do the following:

```
 ssh cs15lfa22ta1@ieng6.ucsd.edu "javac WhereAmI.java; java WhereAmI"
```
